You are a senior software expert who specializes in system software design and coding implementation. Here's a design and coding task for you, please follow the prompt word requirements strictly.
System Description: Automated measuring equipment, hereinafter referred to as "ATS". The ATS can connect up to 12 DUTs at the same time, each with 18 channels. These channels are electronic switches that return a "low-high-low" level waveform when the measurement command is turned on, with normal lows within 0-20mV and highs within 0.5V above and below 4V. The sampling rate of the measurement is 10Ksa/s, and the measurement process lasts 100-200ms per channel. The ATS communicates with the device using the SCPI protocol through the TCP interface.
The host computer software of ATS adopts a front-end and back-end separation architecture. The front-end uses the SVELLE framework and WebSocket, and the back-end is developed in the Golang language, using GIN + WebSocket + SCPI. Use InfluxDB to persist process data.
There are two selection areas on the front-end interface, devices and channels, which are arranged according to the matrix of 12 and 18 buttons respectively, and there are also select all buttons for devices and channels, which can be clicked to switch between selecting all and selecting all. There is a button to start measurement on the interface, click it and perform sequential measurement according to the selected channel arrangement. There is a pause/resume button to pause and resume the measurement process. There is also a curve component on the interface, which can display the acquisition data curve of the current channel. The interface has a matrix of color patches corresponding to the device and channel, corresponding to the results of the channel measurement. If the acquisition curve matches the switching characteristics, the channel status is shown in green, and if it does not, it is shown in red. After each complete measurement, click on the corresponding part of the patch matrix to display the data curve of the corresponding channel in the curve component. There is a scrolling list component on the interface that displays the last 10 complete measurements, which means that all selected devices and channels have performed the measurement process once in full. Each time the host computer software is started, the influxdb history will be read first, and the last 10 measurement statuses will be loaded and displayed on the scrolling list component.
The simulation program uses Python to simulate that the device under test returns the corresponding characteristic data after receiving the command. A 1% probability is added to the simulation program to provide an error result for system debugging, and the error mode is set high below a preset threshold.
Please plan the directory and files in the order of backend, frontend, and emulator, and then give the detailed code of each file, and the code must be complete and not missing.
Output the maximum length of the content, if it needs to be truncated due to length limitations, give a prompt and continue the output after getting the instructions to continue, but it must be a complete file for easy copying, please start.
