The automated measurement equipment, referred to as "ATS" hereafter, can connect to 12 test devices simultaneously, each of which has 18 channels. These channels act as some form of electronic switch, returning a waveform of "low-high-low" levels after a measurement command is initiated. Normal low levels are within 0-20mV, and high levels are within Â±0.5V of 4V. The sampling rate for the measurements is 10Ksa/s, with each channel's measurement process lasting between 100-200ms. Communication between ATS and the devices is conducted via SCPI protocol over a TCP interface. The host computer software of ATS adopts a front-end and back-end separation architecture. The front-end uses the Svelte framework and WebSocket, while the back-end is developed in Golang using Gin + WebSocket + SCPI. InfluxDB is utilized for persisting process data. On the front-end interface, there are two selection areas for devices and channels, arranged in a matrix with 12 and 18 buttons respectively. There are also all-select buttons for devices and channels that allow toggling between selecting all and none when clicked. The interface includes a start measurement button, which initiates sequential measurements based on the selected channels upon clicking. Pause/Resume buttons are available to pause and resume the measurement process. The interface features a curve component that displays the collected data curves of the current channel. There is a color block matrix corresponding to devices and channels, indicating the results of channel measurements. If the collected curve conforms to the switch characteristics, the channel status is displayed in green; otherwise, it is shown in red. After each complete measurement process, clicking the corresponding part of the color block matrix will display the data curve of the respective channel in the curve component. The interface includes a scroll list component that shows the results of the last 10 complete measurements, where a complete measurement means all selected devices and channels have undergone one full measurement process. Every time the host computer software starts up, it first reads historical records from InfluxDB and loads and displays the status of the last 10 measurements in the scroll list component.

Based on the above requirements, provide three program implementation plans for the front-end, back-end, and a simulated switch device. The simulation program can be written in Python, with a 1% probability of providing erroneous results for debugging purposes, setting the error mode so that the high level is below the preset threshold. Please plan directories and files, and provide detailed descriptions of the architectural design, module functions, communication protocols, and human-computer interaction. Upon receiving confirmation, proceed with writing the code, outputting complete files sequentially. If a file needs to be truncated, give a prompt and continue outputting upon receiving further instruction, ensuring that the file remains complete for easy copying. Please begin.

Now, let's start with the code. Please confirm if you want me to proceed with the coding part, and specify which component (front-end, back-end, or device simulator) should be addressed first.
